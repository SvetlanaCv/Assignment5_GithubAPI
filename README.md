# Assignment5_GithubAPI
R code for extracting data from Github using GithubApi

The aim is to extract contributors from a repo and the number of commits they made to it. I expect that the creator of the repository will make the most but I also want to explore how much other contributors will generally add anything.

Code can be run by calling source(file = "script.R") in an R editor while script is in the directory. This produces data.txt, an extract
from Github
