# Assignment5_GithubAPI
R code for extracting data from Github using GithubApi

The aim is to extract contributors from a repo and the number of commits they made to it. I expect that the creator of the repository will make the most but I also want to explore how much other contributors will generally add anything.

The code, specifically script.R, can be run in any R editor, several packages will need to be installed as shown here: install.packages("jsonlite"), install.packages("httr"), install.packages("shiny"), install.packages("ggplot2").
